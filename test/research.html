      <td style="vertical-align: top; width: 556px; background-color: rgb(210, 210, 210); text-align: justify;">My current research can be divided into three projects, trajectories or focal areas:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Performance Composition</span><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Theoretical Composition</span><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">3. Non-Music Composition</span><br>

      <br>

Although these research areas/interests might influence each other I
consider them as separated activities as they have very different
materials, objectives and outputs. However, they are all compositional
activities in the sense that the composer's orientation is the initial
approach. What follows is a further delineation of each area.<br>

      <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Performance Composition - </span>outline<br>

This trajectory is concerned with the conventional setup of music,
namely performed concert music. However, the focus here is an
experimental one and a certain emphasis or priority is put on the
performer's physicality, physical data of the instrument and the
performer's encounter with notation. With these factors fully
prioritized sound becomes a contingent element or a by-product. These
priority factors are understood as potential areas for effort and
challenge in the sense of being capable of 'pressurizing' the performer
into unknown domains. Furthermore, the structure investigated within
this trajectory is the structure of instability, nonlinearity,
non-identity, non-teleology, non-fixity and contingency, which often
places the activities in-between precision and imprecision or as liquid
relations/connections. Form is therefore conceived of as a structure
that embraces instability, ceaseless connections, indefinity,
incompleteness, unpredictability, and above all non-fixity and
non-identity understood as generators of unique outcomes, i.e. each
performance renders a different possible instance of the score,
globally as well as locally. To fulfil this radically the score per se
is heavily criticized both in its conventional layout (left to right
order of events) and as an indicator of moments (the vertical line that
represents a synchronous moment). <br>

      <br>

examples: Negative Dynamics I(a/b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Non-vanishing vacuum state&nbsp;&nbsp;
,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Desiring-Machines&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

      <br>

      <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Theoretical Composition - </span>outline<br>

This trajectory is concerned with a nonconventional composition
practice, namely non-performed scores, pure notation (notation pieces),
imagined music or music that occurs only in the imagination. It is a
conceptual practice. Its materials are therefore often (or even
stipulated as) quantities and qualities that cannot exist except
conceptually. Thus, impossibilities gain the properties of the possible
since within this domain the impossible is the only possibility. Here
the fundamentals of music (such as tempo, dynamics, note-values,
structure, magnitude, etc.) are investigated, but those elements are
treated in isolation or separation from real actual performance. This
activity of theoretical composition takes place within a space defined
by the thresholds of unimaginability. That being said, performance
opportunity or possibility might potentially emerge but only as a
side-effect. Furthermore, theoretical composition explores the
'thinking' of music or what music-in-itself, as a part of the Real, can
think.<br>

      <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; examples: unilateral duality (i)&nbsp; ,&nbsp; Tempo(r(e)al[ity])-lab(oratory/yrinth) (i)<br>

      <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>

3. Non-Music Composition - </span>outline<br>

This trajectory redirects the compositional orientation and points it
at anything outside music (with exceptions). Consequently, pieces or
compositions are made not (only) for instruments but for buildings,
writers, scientific instruments, spaces, objects, robots, people of any
kind and activity of any order. This practice is instruction-based,
meaning it separates the instructive aspect of composing from music;
thus the 'scores' are usually constituted by an instruction text or
performance notes only. However, graphical instructions are also
experimented with although they are usually diagrammatic. These works
are potentially realizable, that is, they ideally could be realized but
not necessarily, and often cannot because of financial reasons, scope
of the work or other organisational factors. It is therefore a
semi-conceptual practice.<br>
