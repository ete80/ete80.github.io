my current research I focus on elaborating something I call
<span style="font-style: italic;">decontextualized
notation</span> and notational experimentation.&nbsp;My
approach is experimental in the sense that it aims to decontextualize
notation, i.e. to place it in an unusual and unfamiliar setting, in
order to see what happens or could potentially happen to notation
both functionally, philosophically, relationally, and artistically or
aesthetically. Notation as such is therefore abstracted
and&nbsp;considered as a certain relationship-tool with undefined
function. Through this approach, notation is not simply a communication
tool between composer and performer but potentially a relationship-tool
between any two agents. This relies on a very basic definition of
notation, namely that notation&nbsp;is a connective force with
mapping
capabilities which thrives on the in-between, meaning it always comes
betwixt. Therefore, notation has great potential to alter perceptions,
give new perspectives, stir up thoughts, and alienate and
defamiliarize. Unquestionably, this artistic research does not confine
itself to music -- although musical notation is in a sense the basic
model on which it relies and deconstructs -- and is therefore more
concerned with generating art objects and theoretical
texts.&nbsp;The
theoretical or conceptual background to all this comes from the concept
'deterritorialization', which is here explored as a process that
decontextualizes a set of relations, rendering them virtual or abstract
and prepares them for more distant actualizations. My approach is also
experimental in the sense that the outcome is not always foreseen, or
what the work becomes when notational acts are put into different
contexts, or differently decontextualized, is sometimes unpredictable. <br>
I
sometimes use 'biopsy' (or autopsy) as a metaphor (with or without the
pathology connotation) for my research: a medical removal of tissue (or
organs in the case of autopsy) from a body for further examination and
analysis. In my case, notation has then been extracted&nbsp;from
the&nbsp;body of music for further examination and experimentation.
<br>
<br>
<br>
My previous (as well as ongoing) research can be divided into three
projects, trajectories or focal areas:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Performance Composition</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Theoretical Composition</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">3. Non-Music Composition</span><br>
<br>
Although these three research areas/interests might influence each
other I
consider them as separated activities as they have very different
materials, objectives and outputs. However, they are all compositional
activities in the sense that the composer's orientation is the initial
approach. What follows is a further delineation of each area.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Performance
Composition - </span>outline<br>
This trajectory is concerned with the conventional setup of music,
namely performed concert music. However, the focus here is an
experimental one and a certain emphasis or priority is put on the
performer's physicality, physical data of the instrument and the
performer's encounter with notation. With these factors fully
prioritized sound becomes a contingent element or a by-product. These
priority factors are understood as potential areas for effort and
challenge in the sense of being capable of 'pressurizing' the performer
into unknown domains. Furthermore, the structure investigated within
this trajectory is the structure of instability, nonlinearity,
non-identity, non-teleology, non-fixity and contingency, which often
places the activities in-between precision and imprecision or as liquid
relations/connections. Form is therefore conceived of as a structure
that embraces instability, ceaseless connections, indefinity,
incompleteness, unpredictability, and above all non-fixity and
non-identity understood as generators of unique outcomes, i.e. each
performance renders a different possible instance of the score,
globally as well as locally. To fulfil this radically the score per se
is heavily criticized both in its conventional layout (left to right
order of events) and as an indicator of moments (the vertical line that
represents a synchronous moment). <br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Theoretical
Composition - </span>outline<br>
This trajectory is concerned with a nonconventional composition
practice, namely non-performed scores, pure notation (notation pieces),
imagined music or music that occurs only in the imagination. It is a
conceptual practice. Its materials are therefore often (or even
stipulated as) quantities and qualities that cannot exist except
conceptually. Thus, impossibilities gain the properties of the possible
since within this domain the impossible is the only possibility. Here
the fundamentals of music (such as tempo, dynamics, note-values,
structure, magnitude, etc.) are investigated, but those elements are
treated in isolation or separation from real actual performance. This
activity of theoretical composition takes place within a space defined
by the thresholds of unimaginability. That being said, performance
opportunity or possibility might potentially emerge but only as a
side-effect. Furthermore, theoretical composition explores the
'thinking' of music or what music-in-itself, as a part of the Real, can
think.<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
3. Non-Music Composition - </span>outline<br>
This trajectory redirects the compositional orientation and points it
at anything outside music (with exceptions). Consequently, pieces or
compositions are made not (only) for instruments but for buildings,
writers, scientific instruments, spaces, objects, robots, people of any
kind and activity of any order. This practice is instruction-based,
meaning it separates the instructive aspect of composing from music;
thus the 'scores' are usually constituted by an instruction text or
performance notes only. However, graphical instructions are also
experimented with although they are usually diagrammatic. These works
are potentially realizable, that is, they ideally could be realized but
not necessarily, and often cannot because of financial reasons, scope
of the work or other organisational factors. It is therefore a
semi-conceptual practice.<br>
