piece explores several theoretical strata involving a specific approach to the
performer&#8217;s physicality. It invents possibly a new dimension in music/notation
and proposes a certain rotation/inversion or even an eversion regarding
performance (the body without an image). Also, a complex relation between
linearity and nonlinearity is explored.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;"><span style="" lang="EN-GB">In the development of silent-objects
in some of my earlier pieces I explored physical/performance activities that
would result in extremities of dynamics: from the very soft to the point of
imperceptibility. My experience regarding these investigations was that
performers somehow took the wrong approach to these activities, or at least
made me realize that I possibly meant something else by them. They wanted to
deliver the sound instead of delivering the silence. But it was also I who took
a wrong approach, namely because I too was delivering sounds; I had a sound in
mind, I was sound-based and my notation confirmed that. This called for a
deregulation of senses (Rimbaud).<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style=""><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;" lang="EN-GB">[1]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></a>
Now, this became a difficult situation: how is it possible to have a <i style="">performed</i> silence, an intensified
silence, and importantly, without any theatricality and other gimmicks.
Moreover, how can there be an action <i style="">not </i>moving
towards sound, i.e. not sound based (as an end result), but instead a movement
towards silence, or better, movement <i style="">of</i>
silence rather than of sound, where sound has an altogether different position and
function. For me, this necessarily stipulates different means of arriving, or a
different path of reaching out (or in), a different aim/effort in the
performance <i style="">control</i> of the
sound/silence couple that is opposite from usual (silence-production instead of
sound-production). This is what constitutes the concept of negative dynamics.
An eversion, so that silences slide into sounds rather than sounds disappear
into silence, or better, something of an opposite movement towards the zero.
This radically changes our notion of dynamics, of the loud and soft, crescendo
and diminuendo &#8211; thus I introduce the negative parameter, my catalyst, the &#8211; </span><span style="font-family: &quot;Opus Text&quot;;" lang="EN-GB">f</span><span style="" lang="EN-GB">. But, what does this parameter
stand for, what does it communicate? Foremost, it has a strong relation to
physicality and that is my first conclusion: I am now quite firmly
physicality-based: as sounds fall below zero one clearly falls into the
physical. So, what, in terms of physicality, does this parameter signify? It
communicates several things. First it must be noted that this 'negative&#8217; is not
a mere opposition or negation, it is a &#8220;positive negativity&nbsp;which
simultaneously suspends and incises, rather than cancels and preserves, every
form of synthetic unity&#8221;.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style=""><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;" lang="EN-GB">[2]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></a>Second,
it communicates a certain 'over-attention&#8217; regarding normal
instrumental/bodily activities, e.g. the depression/release actions. In
the
realm of negative dynamics these actions are equally important; they
equally
require great effort to remain silent. In the case of this piece for
violin
(but it can also apply to other instruments) this applies for both
hands, i.e.
for the left hand as fingers make contact with, and disconnect from,
strings,
and for the bow as it makes contact/disconnection with strings. Because
of the 'over-attention&#8217; the space between the string&#8217;s contact point
and the
full-depression point opens up, receives degrees, becomes
bi-directional, and
becomes equally important as the fingerboard space. Furthermore, the
actions
will, at some point, reach a critical point where silence is most
vulnerable, when
the possibility for emerging sound is high. And logically sounds do
emerge, but
as a secondary consequence, because of the instability of the silence
and not
because a sound should present itself at that moment. Consequently, the
sounds
that appear are unintentional, unplanned or accidental sounds. The
notation
emphasizes this point as it does not notate sounds, instead it notates
physical
actions ideally within movement of silence. <b style=""><o:p></o:p></b></span></p>



      
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;"><b style=""><span style="" lang="EN-GB">Microscopic movements, stipulation/isolation of effort, the body without
an image<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>





      
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;"><span style="" lang="EN-GB">The materials of the piece are the
physical movements as they encounter the instrument. Thus, the micro-movements
of the fingers contacting the strings (as well as the vicinity of the string)
and depressing the string (as well as the release action) are treated within a particular
movement space or frame, meaning they are granted a similar frame as a glissandi
is granted a pitch frame (with upper/lower limits). Here, the amount of time to
release the string is of equivalent importance as it is to depress it. Figure 1
demonstrates these frames for the left-hand fingers, where the lower limit
indicates the fully depressed string while the upper limit indicates the
contact point of the string.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

      
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center; line-height: 150%;" align="center"><span style="" lang="EN-GB"><o:p><img style="width: 530px; height: 134px;" alt="image" src="img/img4.jpg">&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>





      
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;"><span style="" lang="EN-GB"><o:p></o:p>The bow movements are treated in a similar
microscopic way but as they are the main source of friction (and therefore a high
risk sound generator) the effort to remain silent increases, particularly when
the bow-hairs are pressed further down upon the strings while other movements
(lengthwise or crosswise) are active. This forces a certain continuous
adjustment of speed in regard to different movements (depress/release &amp;
lengthwise/crosswise) as they aim for the initial instruction: &#8216;as slow as
silent&#8217;. This means that the performer&#8217;s &#8216;freedom&#8217; or interpretation in regard
to the score consists of slowing down certain movements when appropriate. Here I
must come back to the idea of isolation of effort. The piece exists in the
effort or the struggle to remain silent despite the actions which are to be
executed, a stipulation which is doomed to fail at some point, but
nevertheless, where violation is futile and forbidden. Hence, rather a
stipulation/isolation of struggle, or a certain &#8220;being-separated&#8221;<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style=""><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;" lang="EN-GB">[3]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></a>,
and a notational/performance effort having traces of Evan Johnson&#8217;s notational
impossibilities. Furthermore, this effort receives different intensity levels
in relation to speed, as actions in all 3-dimensional directions (up/down,
in/out, left/right) are put differently under the stress of duration, both
within the piece and between the two versions of the piece (version <i style="">a </i>is 30 seconds while version <i style="">b</i> is 30 minutes, both following the same
score). Likewise, actions are forced towards the extremities of
slowness/smallness in order to maintain the aforementioned stipulation (the
attractor: silence), but simultaneously forced towards acceleration to fulfil
or comply with the durational restrictions (the repellor: movement). Here I
spot again behaviour of nonlinear dynamics: an unstable attractor-origin that
both attracts (slowness) and repels (acceleration); thus creating a limit cycle.
This nonlinear behaviour, which the performer is engaged with, forms a strange
relationship with the linearity of the global physical movements, which are
very linear indeed, i.e. the linear lengthwise movements from the outer limits
of the instrument to the middle. They modulate each other. But this linearity
is only perceived visually and does not trigger forward
implications/projections because of the instability of the silence/sound and
because of the nonlinearity of the silence/sound/physicality effort-space. As a
result, the heaviest impact of the performance is physical, but of a
physical-complex kind where physical effort is, perceptually and executively,
the most identifiable factor. But, I must stress one point regarding this
physicality, because just as I evert the sound/silence direction I invert the
physical energy momentum as well, meaning that I activate an intensive
physicality instead of an extensive one. More precisely, although the physical
movements extend into space or onto an instrument, here they are folded in on
themselves because of their infinitesimally small/slow movements/adjustments,
which capsize their direction. Resultantly, they move inwards (or the focus of
the performer does so), become intensive, and what is more, they perform a
shift from the tactile (outside the body) into the physiological/flesh (inside
the body), entering the realm of sensory receptors found in muscles, tendons
and ligaments &#8211; the proprioceptive area. The performer is thus forced into the
realm of what Brian Massumi calls &#8220;the body without an image&#8221;.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



      
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 35.4pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;"><span style="" lang="EN-GB">&#8220;&#8230;the body without an
image can be understood even more immediately as an effect of <i style="">proprioception</i>, defined as the
sensibility proper to the muscles and ligaments as opposed to tactile
sensibility (which is &#8220;exteroceptive&#8221;) and visceral sensibility (which is
&#8220;interoceptive&#8221;)&#8221; ... &#8220;Proprioception folds tactility into the body, envelopes
the skin&#8217;s contact with the external world in a dimension of medium depth:
between epidermis and viscera &#8230; As infolding, the faculty of proprioception
operates as a corporeal transformer of tactility into quasi corporeality &#8230; Its
vectors are perspectives of the flesh&#8221;.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style=""><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;" lang="EN-GB">[4]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></a><o:p></o:p></span></p>
