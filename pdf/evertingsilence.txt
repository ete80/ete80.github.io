Everting Silence
Notating Clandestine Forces
(outline of a research-in-progress)
Einar Torfi Einarsson
Professor of Composition
Iceland University of the Arts
Thanks…good to be back…
This talk titled [Everting Silence] revolves around a thread of my on-and-off research for the
past years and must be considered to be an ongoing, or in-progress, research, -- as is
maybe always the case with artistic research, since there is no end, no final say about the
matter, nor conclusions as such (and maybe that can be said about knowledge in general).
But I am going to frame the area of exploration where silence is not merely a Rest or a
Pause (Hold)…it can also be thought as a secret, as an active intensive force, hiding itself in
a complex web of interactions (a web of lies and truths? (fictions and facts, figments and
materiality):
This ongoing project asks the question: how can we rethink silence as a dynamic,
performative, and notational material? And through that, it explores the aesthetics of the
clandestine, or the multifaceted secret.

+ “…the secret, defined as a content that has hidden its form in
favor of a simple container, is inseparable from two movements
that can accidentally interrupt its course or betray it, but are
nonetheless an essential part of it: something must ooze from the
box, something will be perceived through the box or in the halfopened
box. The secret was invented by society; it is a sociological
or social notion. Every secret is a collective assemblage. The secret
is not at all an immobilized or static notion. Only becomings are
secrets; the secret has a becoming”
+ ---D&G, TP. (emphasis mine)
I want to start with this quote from Deleluze and Guattari’s A thousand Plateaus:
Secrets are hush-hush, they are to be kept silent….but they usually don’t, not
completely…they have the tendency to leak…
Few keywords that I draw out of this quote:
The secret is important, the perception is important – when you sense the secret you
aren’t IN on it, you start to imagine all kind of things – this is also the social aspect is also
important….BUT I WILL COME BACK TO THESE LINKS.
Two movements (that can interrupt or betray): Influence and doublings?
(influence on the surroundings, and the doubling within it
as more secret aspect (secret group within a secret group))
Continuing secret groups = Becoming (imperceptible)

Colliding Spaces and Silent Actions

Rethinking silence as dynamic and
performative element
+Silence as difference as quantum vacuum…
+Identity
+Emptiness
The importance of Analogical thinking:
The classical conception of silence can be compared to other classical concepts within
philosophy on one hand, and physics, on the other hand.
The concept of identity within philosophy did, or does, represent something static, fixed,
something identical, it has a structural fixity, a grounded phenomenon. The post-structural
conception of identity turns it into something dynamic, liquid (like the liquid identity
Zygmunt Bauman speaks of), or as with Deleuze it is thought as Difference, which is, of
course, never static nor fixed, but ongoing. We could of course take countless examples of
this but you get the point. [QUOTE?]
Similarly, the classical conception of empty space, namely the vacuum, was conceived of as
being void of energy, particles, or activity. However, the quantum vacuum is far from being
empty, it is immensely complex state, full of undefined activity, indeed full of secrets or
secretive becomings. [QUOTE, FIGURE?]
---
The title of this talk makes use of another concept that comes from mathematics, namely
eversion, which is the process of turning a shape inside out (without tearing or puncturing
it) and challenges our intuition about space and shape…..but eversion has also been used in
other contexts which is relevant for my approach. E.g. In psychoanalytic theory, "eversion"
has been used to describe the process of turning unconscious desires or impulses outward
4
and expressing them in conscious behavior. For example, the psychologist Jacques Lacan
used the term to describe the process of "mirror-stage inversion," in which an individual
externalizes their inner conflicts and desires through symbolic acts and behaviors. Here I
emphasise the making subconscious forces conscious. Metaphorically I connect this to
physical, or performative movements, that are often subconsciously active in music
performance, but also of imagined elements that may also be seen as subconscious
elements of performance and interpretation. These are thus turned inside-out in the sense
of becoming material (this will become clearer when we talk about notation).

+ Silence as difference as

+ Emptiness
+ Eversion
+ The process of turning a
shape inside out
The title of this talk makes use of another concept that comes from mathematics, namely
eversion (I use it as a verb), which is the process of turning a shape inside out (without
tearing or puncturing it) and challenges our intuition about space and shape…..but eversion
has also been used in other contexts which is relevant for my approach. E.g. In
psychoanalytic theory, "eversion" has been used to describe the process of turning
unconscious desires or impulses outward and expressing them in conscious behavior. For
example, Jacques Lacan used the term to describe the process of "mirror-stage inversion,"
in which an individual externalizes their inner conflicts and desires through symbolic acts
and behaviors. Although I’m not working with Lacan’s concept, I emphasise this making
subconscious forces conscious. Metaphorically I connect this to physical, or performative
movements, that are often subconsciously active in music performance, but also of
imagined elements that may also be seen as subconscious elements of performance and
interpretation. These are thus turned inside-out in the sense of becoming material (this will
become clearer when we talk about notation later on).
But what fascinates me with the concept of eversion is the process associated, it has a very
complex step-by-step process where something smooth like a sphere, which looks the
same from all perspectives, and we could say perfect and pure like our classical concepts
often are, but this is transformed into something quite different, and I must focus on the
steps or stages, as they reveal many different shapes, perspectives and a hidden reality,
another secret.
5
The figure here, highlights only few of the stages and without going deeper into the
mathematics of this (which I don’t really understand) what I want to take from this is the
energy involved in this process, there is pushing, pulling, bending, self-intersections, bulging
and twisting.
This is one abstract model I try to work with, where silence is the sphere (but only in an
abstract sense) that goes through this process both conceptually and performatively.

Becomings…
+ Becoming-imperceptible
+ “becoming-molecular—which
occur precisely at the point
where the secret has lost both its
content and its form, where the
imperceptible, the clandestine
with nothing left to hide, has
finally been perceived.” ---
D&G, TP.
+ Becoming-intense
This transformation of the smooth sphere, as some ideal, a perfection, is a process with an
end stage (in the mathematic version). To escape this final stage, this completion, I connect
this process rather to becoming,… which can be seen in relation to Deleuze’s focus on
becomings (becomings are secrets). There are many becomings in Deleuze and Guattari’s
work, and here I connect three interrelated becomings: imperceptible, molecular, intense.
READ
(remember earlier quote: “secret defined as a content that has hidden its form”)
“Some people can talk, hide nothing, not lie: they are
secret by transparency, as impenetrable as water, in truth
incomprehensible.”
This is another kind of secret, which I look at as something dynamic residing in silence,
ready to be perceived, a secret silence that doesn’t need sound to hide itself. Sound could
therefore take this function of a form, which gives silence its content.
And here is another secret becomings where content and form is lost, and the
imperceptible is finally perceived = this is a recipe for silent music, perceived silence,
performed silence, perceived secret, clandestine performance. But immediately a question
6
of how to approach that.
We are looking at all this through the lens of silence and the process of eversion, so we are
saying that silence must now be thrown on these becomings –intense, -imperceptible…
-intensive silence (like temperature increase), so the silence is becoming-intense
But what about this Content and form being lost = secret for the secret’s sake or silence for
the silence’s sake = silence must become, not something fixed, but thrown onto the state of
becoming (intense, imperceptible, etc.). We could also relate this to the conventional role of
silence as rests, pause, etc., and having a certain role in the context of sound, which could be
said to force upon silence a certain form and content, and so we can ask: what happens
when we remove that context?
---
? Elsewhere D+G talk about infinite form of secrecy:
About “the possibility of there being an infinite form of
secrecy that no longer even requires a content
and that has conquered the imperceptible.” ---this is
another abstract model or even objective of my project,
where we perceive secret that has conquered the
imperceptible.

So through everting the conceptual silence, we enter
becomings where the secret escapes its usual form/shape
and content and we start to wonder what that might entail.

Separation vs.
proximity
spaces
+ Two points in space as different
meeting points within the instrumentperformer
space.
+ Separation spaces
+ Proximity spaces
+ Open sets
Back to mathematics, where two other concepts, from topology can be found: separation
spaces and proximity spaces.
(About these concepts in mathematics)
Separation space is a type of topological space where any two distinct points have disjoint
neighborhoods. In other words, for any two points in the space, there exist open sets
around each point that do not contain the other point. But they have an area, they have
surroundings. Intuitively, this means that points in a separation space can be separated
from each other by open sets.
Every point in an open set has a "room" around it that is also contained in the set (that
room is part of it). An open set does not contain any of its boundary points, which are the
points that are "on the edge" of the set. These spaces are important when I start to think
about performative microspaces and movements within them.
((On the other hand, a proximity space is a more general concept that allows for points to
be "near" each other without necessarily being separated by open sets. It defined how
close and when two points are considered near each other. A proximity space defines a
relation between points that captures their closeness. For example, a proximity space
might define a "nearness" relation that says that two points are close if they are within a
8
certain distance of each other. Unlike separation spaces, proximity spaces do not require that
any two points be separated by open sets.))
The two movements, or simply two points, be it locations or spaces of activity, as separated
worlds or approaching each other.
These are inspirational elements but also create a powerful analogy on a conceptual level.
(this image is a visualization of the process of eversion which I’m using as an analogy for
layers of silence, the process of rethinking it but also imagining the interactions of different
parts of silence, what parts are active within silence). This I have to relate to the instrumentperformer
phenomenon.
8
Separation vs. proximity spaces
+Two points in space as different
meeting points within the
instrument-performer space.
+Separation spaces
+Proximity spaces
+Open sets
To clarify where I’m going with this: I’m connecting this to the instrument-performer space.
SS have open-sets, an area of activity, but proximity spaces define their nearness, their
closeness, or when they can be considered to enter that space: I’m thinking this, again, as a
process, a movement of two points, which have their separation spaces, where they can be
active, but once they are close enough they start to interact differently, they enter their
proximity spaces.
I am connecting these ideas about spaces to the Instrument-Performer situation, and
importantly, as microspaces of physical activity:
Performer’s hands (as points in space)
Performer’s hands vs. mouth (as points in space)
Performer’s fingers (as points in space)
And all these “points” I connect to Location points on the instruments and their open sets
(this is the area surrounding hands and instruments).
So for me this is about physicality, and here the conceptual dimension connects with the
physical, and there is materiality. Each performed action is through this deemed as a space,
having locality, vicinity, a direction perhaps, and a dimensionality.
Etc. This will become clearer later on when we look at some concrete examples.
9
When we look closely at any two, or more, such meeting points and their respective spaces
within this field of performative activity we see endless zones of proximity, which brings us
back to Deleuze…
(re-notations, )
9
Zone of proximity
+“We could also put it this way: Becoming is to emit particles
that take on certain relations of movement and rest because
they enter a particular zone of proximity. Or, it is to emit
particles that enter that zone because they take on those
relations. A haecceity is inseparable from the fog and mist
that depend on a molecular zone, a corpuscular space.
Proximity is a notion, at once topological and quantal, that
marks a belonging to the same molecule, independently of
the subjects considered and the forms determined.”
+D&G, TP
In the outline of becoming-intense (and becoming-imperceptible) D & G speak of the zone
of proximity.
I think when we are within this zone there is no way discerning movement from rest, they
become not-one but both simultaneously, that is their relation. This is an important
interpretation for me, which says that movement or motion is within rest and vice versa,
where I try to equate movement and rest. [movement and silence, but also turning
movement into silence]
This quote speaks of emitting particles, which is precisely what my project aims to
experiment with, that is what kind of particles are emitted when rest and movement enter
this zone.
What is also important here is the Corpuscular space = tiny area, where activity of
movement and rest is so condensed that it can only be imperceptible and highly intense.
This also connects to the separation spaces but now emphasize their microscopic nature.
Movements can take place in tiny spaces.
D&G, TP. P.273
10
Zone of proximity
+“…it is because it constitutes a zone of proximity and
indiscernibility, a no-man's-land, a nonlocalizable relation
sweeping up the two distant or contiguous points, carrying
one into the proximity of the other—and the borderproximity
is indifferent to both contiguity and to distance.”
+D&G, TP
D & G continue
Indiscernibility = inability to distinguish = secret = within silence, folded.
Here I am interpreting this as the collision of movement and rest, but also of sound and
silence, because to make a sound we need action but for this kind of silence I’m after we
also need actions, secretive actions. So, I also connect this to the instrument-performer
space.
The two points are either movement or rests, or forces of production and modulation, not
production of sound but silences. (see instrument vs. performer = instrument is silent
without the performer (force))
See this simply as performer vs. instruments, but also action vs. silence, and layered
movements (actions) of the performer.
To be indifferent to distance? No matter the actual size of these spaces they should be
equally dynamic.

Summary
+The Secret as a dynamic hidden form
+Eversion as a (layered) process, as a verb (everting), as a
becoming…
+Becoming-imperceptible = infinite secret = performed silence
+Separation spaces vs. proximity spaces = performative
movements = locations and (split) physicality
+Zone of proximity = corpuscular spaces where movement and
rest become indiscernible.
This is the conceptual map reflecting certain elements from philosophy and mathematics.

Musical context - silence
+Types of silences in music
Rests
Pause
Meanings
After this conceptual network building I want to map a certain musical context, which my
research grows out of. Of course myriad of musical influences are always at work so we can
never have a complete map but I will highlight some important threads.
First, we can quickly run through the types of musical silences I’m not really focusing on but
are still, I think, relevant for any deconstruction of the phenomenon:
Basic two categories:
Rests: They are part of Shaping rhythm, shaping sound. = notated character = and can be
seen as the secret of the first kind, that hides inbetween sounds.
Pauses: articulation, breath, dramatic (tensions) = interpretive factor that creates: Nuance,
tension, even Climax = it’s a different kind of secret that isn’t notated. Frozen moment.
Importantly, they are part of the perception mechanism of music and have a great impact
on the meaning of music? Another important element to consider is: that these silences, of
both categories, are often communicated through physical gestures in performance, i.e.
they form another layer in the semiotics of music.
--
Jennifer Judkins in her article “The Aesthetics of Silence in Live Musical Performance''
mentions “long unmeasured silences are given individual meaning and form by the tonal
and rhythmic material surrounding them (their musical edges) and they are characterized
13
both by these edges and by physical gesture in performance” (Judkins 1997, 40)
There is obviously a lot of literature on these aspects, but we are everting, which means we
are not rejecting we are gaining perspectives.

Musical context - silence
+Early examples (humor, critique, futures…)
+Samuel (aka. Del Valle de Paz)
+Edward Schulhoff
+“Unsilencing” the Silence: Unacknowledged Silent Pieces
+ ---Eder Wilker Borges Pena
+OPUS v.26, n.3, set./dez. 2020
But silence has also been employed in totally different ways, where it takes on a very
different role within music:
Philosophical role, aesthetic, critical, political, and within this lineage, there is an
interesting early example, which I think shouldn’t be dismissed.
These are late 19th century examples where silence was used as a critique on the
development of music and this is done through humor, but also to contemplate and
speculate about the future of music. Importantly, it is only through notation that these
particular silences can communicate.
This interesting article, Unsilencing the silence, highlights these early histories of silent
music, which I will not go deep into at this point, but I will take few examples.
We should not dismiss any of these histories…
14
Samuel (aka. Del Valle de Paz)
Il Silenzio (1896)
First one by Samuel (aka. Del Valle de Paz) – Italian pianist and professor in Florence
Il Silenzio -- Published in La Nuova Musica
His self-claimed humorous piece critiques the quality of
pieces previously published in the journal and some
practices of so-called modern music, or, the avant-garde
of the time. The core of the joke is that the pieces
published were so bad and of such poor quality that
silence was preferable: “if you have nothing good to say
then remain silent.”
But still, I think there is something more here than
humor, it points to a landscape of rests and movements,
15
where phrasings and dynamics become foregrounded. For
me this is not empty music but the beginning of thinking
about dynamic silence (even glimpsing the zone of
proximity where silence starts to behave like sound).
15
Samuel (aka. Del Valle de Paz)
Il Silenzio (1896)

Il Silenzio
Another interesting thing about these pieces is that they are quite active notationally,
Even though the message intended was perhaps emptiness, the notational image
communicates other elements. And importantly this approach permits a certain
play with contradictions and imagination of possibilities, e.g., the entangled
accidentals, and my favourite: the trilling silence, the simultaneous ritardando and
accelerando, and the crescendo silence. In this sense the piece is a challenge to our
imagination, an invitation to rethink silence as material.

Erwin Schulhoff (b. 1894)
Fünf Pittoresken, III: In Futurum (1930)
Similar thing is happening with this piece by the Dada influenced Czech composer
Erwin Schulhoff. But here he is framing the piece as a
speculation about the future, as the title suggests, not as
a humorous critique. But we see again how the notation
allows the imagination to run a bit wild.
17
Erwin Schulhoff (b. 1894)
Fünf Pittoresken, III: In Futurum (1930)
But not as wild as the previous example (which is curious as this one speculates about the
future), the other one did include many more contradictions, so Samuel’s piece somehow
stumbled upon a very interesting dimension of notation, namely its powers of fiction.
But here we have Gestures: upwards/downwards movements, rests in motion. We are
entering the zone of proximity here, but only on paper.
Conclusion: playful, Notational fantasy, speculation = never thought for performance, or as
performative score, but nevertheless they do open a door to imagination? That character is
important to my approach.
18
Musical context
+John Cage’s silence
Roughly 50 years later we have Cage’s silence, which is a Silence performed! (essentially
about performance also) = stillness = inactive performer = active ears = environment enters
= mode of listening
Two aspects from the performer’s perspective: (1) definition of silence as inactivity, (2)
what Tudor added: between the movements: the intensified action in the silent landscape
is very interesting (because only then silent action becomes perceptible).
Silence is here questioned for the listener (there is no silence, only new layer of sound, the
environment is full of activity), but not for the performer (silence = inaction).
The piece Opens up a listening space through silence, and that is what I’m taking from it,
the threshold space where environmental sounds leak through = this is the secret in Cage’s
silence.
---M arche Funèbre by Alphonse Allais
19
Musical context: Dieter Schnebel
Another favourite of mine is Umrisse by Diter Schnebel. From the Mo-No – Music to read
(which dates back to 1969).
It combines all the elements we saw in the early works, but I think unknowingly. What
interests me here is the layerings, the counterpoint of silences.
This was never intended for performance just like the early examples, but rather for
speculation, and to my knowledge there has never been any attempt to perform these
pieces.
The intention is different however, Schnebel is not thinking about the future or critiquing
new music, but rather speculating or imagining a challenge, and maybe exploring the right
of music to exist in this form alone, speculative form.
But I took this as a challenge to find performative solutions, in that sense I call this
theoretical composition, which obviously demands a reaction of an experimental nature.

Musical context
+Salvatore Sciarrino
+Threshold of silence
+Textured silence
+Fragility
+Techniques + material
Infinito Nero (1998)
I will now move to another kind of musical context, which is equally important for my
project.
In the music of Sciarrino we have these areas that operate on the threshold of silence,
drawing the ear into that zone, and in that fine-tuned zone we get a texture that is often
integrated with the silence Cage unearthed, where the environment blends with fragile
sounds. It’s more dynamic, but perhaps not silent enough. Sciarrino focuses on techniques
and materials that can function within this zone and in that sense I explore similar tactics.
So, elements of Sciarrino-like moments are to be expected, but they will never be notated
like this, because for me these are notated sounds, not silences.

+Brian Ferneyhough = notational spaces, layerings
+Evan Johnson
+Aaron Cassidy Unity Capsule (1976)
Other important names, I have to mention, and which aspects I’m building on.
--Lachenmann
From L, I subsume the aspect of opening up performative spaces within instruments,
allowing them presence as radical (equality) of material. Also the idea that sound is the
meeting point of forces. For here I equate that with the idea that those “forces” can also
have a proximity spaces (and preparation zone) and therefore not necessarily a sonic
outcome. This relates to prescriptive notation which delineates actions as forces instead of
descriptions of sonic outcomes, allowing to notate silence instead of sounds.
Notational spaces = instrumental zones (all zones are possible) = meetings of forces, and of
spaces. There is however no unpredictable interplay of forces in Lachenmann, but they are
in F.

--E.Johnson = obviously layerings with the heritage of F, where indeed contradictions reside
almost everywhere.
But in this piece Linke Hand Eines Apostels (for harpsichord and 12 instruments) the
material for the harpsichord is split between the manuals, where the lower manual
(staffless L) is disengaged (meaning the keyboard doesn’t connect to the plectra
mechanism, so the keyboard doesn’t activate the strings) and is termed “silent” in the
performance notes. This can be interpreted as intensive silence or performed silence, its
function is to be intensifying as silent counterpoint. It’s in many ways similar to the
counterpoint explored by Schnebel we saw before, only now part of performance (we start
to see a pattern). There are also impossibilities here and there in Evans works, that explore
the fictional space of notation, which I think is also important to explore further.

however they were not really framed within the context
ND =
Proto-scores = the zone of proximity first explored (somewhat subconsciously) = the precontact
space as notated material, the imagination of action as notational material?
?? I say notational material but this is also performative material, but imagination-of-action
as material might not result in any action, but might influence actions…
VIDEO: (underdetermined figures), (stilla #1), other proportions? (24:50)
In the most simple and abstract way I think of this activity as colliding open sets as
proximity spaces that potentially can collide
26
Negative Dynamics Ia/b – (string instr.)
(2011)
[Volume 70%]
The first piece where I start to explore this area is Negative Dynamics I a/b.
Two versions exist, one 30’’ and the other 30’ - I think here many of the seeds started to
germinate, but it took me some time to figure it out.
This piece was written as part of developing the concept of negative dynamics during my
PhD. –
In a way it was a result of trying to perform these pieces by Schnebel, these dynamic
silences that fluctuate from zero into a negative parameter, subzero dynamics: –F. It lives on
the other side of the dynamic axis and tries to open up that dimension.
It is about the direction of energy, different form of communication, deliberately hiding vs.
trying to convey something. How do you convey silence where a sound is an accident? The
idea here was to reverse the conventional direction of communication, communicating
silences where sounds are only accidental “pauses”. I now think reversal is the wrong
approach but this opened up a new thinking space.
Quote phd-thesis? As-slow-as-silent.

Zoom in on the score:
27
Defining a space but placing information in the vicinity of that space = opening up the
surroundings, the proximity space:
The top line in all three pressure staves indicates the
contact point between strings and fingers/bow. Utmost
care and prudence should
be taken when arriving at, and departing from, this line.
The space above the line is in the realm of: as close as
almost. The bottom line
indicates extremes of pressure, stress and tension.
The proportions of the spaces are here somewhat correct,
ie. they represent them according to their actual sizes. This
is something I’m questioning at the moment as this brings
about a clear hierarchy, at least notationally, which I think
sends the wrong message since what the piece tries to say
is that spaces are all equally important, even though the
notation doesn’t reflect this.

Abstract model:
colliding proximity spaces
+ Silently active Zones (imperceptible secrets):
+ Instrument space // I-proximity space
+ Performer space // P-proximity space
+ Conceptual/imagination space
+ Occasionally colliding
Coming back to the conceptual links, namely the separation & proximity spaces and seeing
them as abstract models.
Then it becomes part of the Methods: abstract modelling, moving open sets, clashing into
each other “potential” borders. Clashing can create sound but can also simply mean
occupying same space without emitting sound-particles, an intensified location.
Next: defining what those spaces are, giving them locations and dimensionality (space for
actions)
These spaces can be further subdivided into more layers (as the drawings within the circles
here represent), e.g. the performer-space can be divided into different activities of the
hands, mouths, areas on the instrument, etc.
Each area on the instrument space receives a proximity space (each point is considered as
an open set), which extends the area/space into actual physical space (surrounding that
area, creating the nearness/proximity space), which in turn becomes a movement space for
the performer’s actions, this is the notated material, as all these spaces have to be defined
notationally.
35
De/Re-coupling sound & silence
+Two movements of the Instrument-performer hybrid
+decoupling of sound and silence (production part vs.
modulating part) -- zone of proximity
+ = silent actions = opening up proximity spaces
+Contradictions: action=sound, inaction=silence
Applying the abstract model? (to different aspects of performance)
Two movements (of the secret): influence (on surroundings), and doublings (inner and/or
hyper secrets)
The silent part of producing a sound through action, which is usually a part that modulates
a force through a space (physical description), in wind instruments it’s airstream that gets
modulated, in strings it’s a vibrated string. So, part of the body is always busy with silently
modulating factors. These forces could be viewed as clandestine forces, a secret within
performance, secret production of sound, and that is what my projects aims to do elevate
or empower. One way of doing that is by enlarging the zone of activity, mapping its active
field, creating new potentials. And thinking them through the zone of proximity so as to
make them equal.
Through notation that is inclusive of the impossible.

Notation: design and conceptual
aspects
+Current work-in-progress: Zone of proximity (and the weakly
interacting massive particles) - (rec.+vcl.) (2023-)
+Notational spaces, colliding spaces
+Micro-movements within, intensely fast/slow (imperceptible)
+Schizoanalysis
+Intensifiers (excitations in the field)
+Tempo containers
+Layerings
+Real vs. fictional elements (possible-impossibilities)
Integrated into the notational system and the generation of material is Schizoanalysis which
I see as opening up spaces (the becoming conscious, the groundless splitting of layers =
interactions of the web of spaces)
In Chaosmosis, Guattari explains that "rather than moving in the direction of reductionist
modifications which simplify the complex", schizoanalysis "will work towards its
complexification, its processual enrichment, towards the consistency of its virtual lines of
bifurcation and differentiation, in short: towards its ontological heterogeneity”
Opening up the imaginative dimension, which is not about execution or action but what
precedes an action or accompanies them (and how that is influenced, or what can
influence it): when things are not necessarily sounding, they become differently important
in the notation (detail of another nature then precision), it might become a fictional aspect
that informs the performer indirectly, or theoretically or philosophically, or in some other
way. This opens up the strange space of fiction within the notational space. Examples of
this is compactifications = hiding actions in time (see tempo subdivisions).
-compactification?
to make or become compact; esp of higher dimensions in space-time, to become tightly
curved so as to be unobservable under normal circumstances

Walk through:

-the secret is hiding these actions, the secret can be an impossible action which is still part
of reading the text.

Collaborations
+ELISION Ensemble – solos, duos, etc.
+Guitarist Pétur Jónasson (member of the Riot Ensemble)
+Others?
I must stress that such a project is almost unthinkable without a collaboration with openminded,
explorative performers. And I am lucky to have a working relationship with the
ELISION Ensemble who are willing to explore this with me, as well as the classical guitarist
Pétur Jónasson (of the Riot Ensemble). I am sure that the project will be shaped further
through these collaborations, when I can integrate the performer’s insights, comments,
perspectives, etc.

Aesthetics of The Clandestine?
+Perceived silent act reveals a secret without content.
+Balancing of silent activity/inactivity, silent micro-actions, nearsilent
activity, occasional collisions (with sonic results, leaks)
+=> everted silence
+Social dimension: Intense activity being silenced, inaccessible
domains, privacy issues (private worlds), cryptic means…
+Communication is always incomplete, always half-empty,
always needs translation/interpretation/guesswork, always
includes a secret, clandestine forces.
+Necessarily notational as the mapping of hidden layers
This approach could be said to Advocate for the Aesthetics of the clandestine, which could
be outlined as a challenge to the senses, in a way to supercharge the senses, to
amplify them in contrast to contemporary culture that numbs the senses. It
tries to capture the observed presence of something out of reach, it aims for emphasized
tension produced between the perceptible and the imperceptible, or thrives exactly on that
border space. This reflects several aspects of the world and contemporary society, and has
therefore this social dimension.
But also of communication in general. Silences are embedded in our language as gestures
of hesitation, of breaks and pauses, but also as things that are not allowed to be said. So,
communication is always incomplete or we could say full of secrets. And I’m asking how we
can flip the proportions so to speak, so that we create a language of silence where sounds
become the hesitations and pauses, or rather hesitations, secrets and breaks is all there is,
where the imperceptible speaks.

“To simplify, an artificial neural-network system relies on layers of artificial
neurons to process information. These layers of artificial neurons are connected
and influence each other in a complex web of interacting units, somewhat like
biological neurons are understood to do in a biological brain. A lower layer of

enriching the final outcome of the layer at the top. What is obtained in each layer
is a new representation, ‘which can be used as input for deeper layers’ (Bengio,

calculations and modify its interactions by tuning parameters via activation and
back-propagation among layers until the desired output (i.e. the desired final
representation) is produced. The network, however, is called deep if its
structure encompasses intermediary ‘hidden’ layers between the input and

+Dark Matter (aesthetics)
+Presence of infinite secrecy?
+Temporality?
I’m currently exploring and mapping more connections.
The social dimension, the call for transparency on all levels of society, and this relates also
to the black-box algorithms:
The network, called deep neural network, a structure consisting of many intermediary
‘hidden’ layers between the input and the output. The architecture of a deep-learning
system differs from that of a standard artificial neural network precisely because of the
presence of these multiple non-linear hidden layers, which cannot be transparent.
Dark matter = difficult to detect, beyond our technology, challenging our imagination and
understanding? Wimps, massive particles that are believed to be responsible for the mass
that is missing in the universe, yet affecting all regular (sounding) matter (they are sort of a
fiction, but mathematically made to fit our current understanding of the universe, these
attempts at the limits of our knowledge where we are faced with a complete darkness that
nevertheless leaves a trace of its own existence, a leaking secret.)
So, maybe the secret was not invented by society as Deleuze said, but is a fundamental
aspect of the universe.
Other things I still need to figure out are questions of presence and temporality, ie. what
sort of presence and temporality such performances can explore.

Certainly! "Modern Silence" is a paper by David Metzer that was published in the Journal of
the American Musicological Society in 2012. The paper explores the concept of silence in
modern music and how it has been used by composers to create a sense of tension and
anticipation.
Metzer begins by discussing the use of silence in John Cage's 4'33", a piece that consists
entirely of silence. He argues that the piece challenges our understanding of music and
raises important questions about the role of silence in music.
Metzer then examines the use of silence in the music of Morton Feldman, a composer who
used silence extensively in his compositions. He argues that for Feldman, silence was not
just the absence of sound but an active element that shaped the listener's experience of
the music.
42
Metzer also discusses the use of silence in the music of Gyorgy Ligeti, who used silence as a
way of creating tension and contrast in his compositions. He argues that Ligeti's use of
silence reflects his interest in the psychology of perception and the way that listeners process
musical information.
Finally, Metzer explores the use of silence in the music of Brian Ferneyhough, a composer
who used silence as a way of challenging traditional musical structures and conventions. He
argues that Ferneyhough's use of silence reflects his interest in exploring the boundaries of
musical expression and the limits of the human ear.
Overall, Metzer's paper offers a nuanced and insightful analysis of the use of silence in
modern music. He argues that silence is not simply the absence of sound but an active
element that composers can use to shape the listener's experience of the music.

Types of silences (social dimension)
Silences and perception?
Jennifer Judkins in her article “The Aesthetics of Silence in Live Musical Performance''
mentions “long unmeasured silences are given individual meaning and form by the tonal
and rhythmic material surrounding them (their musical edges) and they are characterized
both by these 22 edges and by physical gesture in performance” (Judkins 1997, 40)
